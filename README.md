mixture-modelling
=================

Implementation of EM to fit (multivariate) gaussian mixture models to data using any user-specified metric. I was using [mixtools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mixtools/index.html), but my data was a frame of latitude and longitude, and mixtools only supports the standard Euclidean metric.
